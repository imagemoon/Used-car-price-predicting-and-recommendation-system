    "# Used Car Price Predicting Website Application (UCPPWA)\n",
    "### APMAE4990 Final Proposal \n",
    "## Fanchen Zeng (fz2241)    Season Yang (sy2679)    Yizhe Gao (yg2470)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been over 10,000 used cars searched within a 75-mile radius from major cities, including Chicago, Washington, New York, Seattle, etc. It is always a hard problem for the owners to price their used cars given the fact that there is a wide distribution of prices for cars with different conditions. They could guess but this is not an efficient way to maximize money for their cars. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be using the data to create a web app that could help car owners in New York area price their used cars based on specific car conditions. Specifically, users should be able to enter their used car conditions and the web app should generate the range of price which would most likely to maximize price of their cars.\n",
    "## Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Used car sellers in New York area who want to get estimate prices of their cars. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Used car buyers in New York area who need recommendations for potential used car options. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Practitioners who want to analyze the used car market\n",
    "\n",
    "## Component\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prodicting System\n",
    "\n",
    "We decide to use parametric regression (Linear Ridge Regression) and nonparametric regession (Random Forests Regression) models to prodict the used car price\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"picture/Ridge.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"picture/Random Forests2.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feedback Learning System\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to generate data to improve predicting accuracy, our team introduce a feedback learning system in the UCPPWA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedback learning system collects used car price data from the price input of users and from website https://www.cargurus.com/, http://www.autotrader.com/ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will be giving a reasonable weight to the new data, where the weight can be learned from empirical market research or regression result of existed dataset with time series\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"picture/weighted sample.png\"></p>\n",
    "<h6 align=\"center\">Fig.1. Weighted Sample</h6> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "To better serve the potential buyers, our team decides to use PCA to reduct the dimension as well as extract features and k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict the optimal range in which the people would potentially buy. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"picture/KNN.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"></p>\n",
    "<h6 align=\"center\">Fig.2. kNN Algorithm </h6> \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Visualization Website Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by the demonstration of building classification in New York and San Francisco. Our team decides to create a website application to demonstrate our dataset and our systems in UPCCWA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prodicting System which uses Ridge Regression and Random Forests Regression can be easily solved and improved by tuning the alpha in Ridge and tree parameters in Random Forests. By now we have achieved about 0.6 R Square for Ridge and more than 0.8 R Square for Random Forests in testing dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The two key parts in Feedback Learning System are receiving feedback and using updated dataset to re-learn. We will design the web application to be able to receive and store inputs from the users as new data and the algorithms will run automatically after a given period of time to learn the updated data to update the coefficients in Ridge and the decision tree in Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Although the popular algorithm of recommendation system is Collaborative Filtering which is mainly used in Facebook, Netflix and so on, kNN is also applied for basic recommendation system and own a good performance. Thus, applying and modifying the kNN to our Recommendation System are feasible\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A large number of APIs and open code for website are the useful tools for us to build the Visualization Website Application\n",
